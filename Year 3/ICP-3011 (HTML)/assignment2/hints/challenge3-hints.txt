Hint 1
Take a look at the editprofile.gtl page that users and administrators use to edit profile settings.

Gruyere into letting you use this page to update your account?

Hint 2
Can you figure out how to fool Gruyere into thinking you used this page to update your
account?


Hint 1
You don’t need to look at the Gruyere cookie parsing code. You just need to know what the
cookies look like. Gruyere’s cookies use the format:
hash|username|admin|author

Hint 2
Gruyere issues a cookie when you log in. Can you trick it into issuing you a cookie that looks
like another user’s cookie?
